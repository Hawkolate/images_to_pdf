# Images To PDF
Some code, mostly taken from stackoverflow and the Pillow documentation. Made a twelve page comic book using Blender, needed a way to easily turn the images into a pdf.

[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27327513/create-pdf-from-a-list-of-images#47283224)


## Usage
1. Create a file named "file_path.txt" containing the directory with images.
2. Output file will be named "book.pdf".
